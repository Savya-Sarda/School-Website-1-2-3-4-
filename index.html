This is one of three basketball courts that middle schoolers have access to. Students come here at all times of the day to play basketball, hang out with friends, watch people play basketball, or sometimes even to learn Basketball during a physical education period. This basketball court is not really placed in a good position as it is near several classrooms that have glass doors and if a student/staff accidentally misses a shot then it could break the glass. The school is planning to replace this court with a walkway. Although, if they do replace it then some passionate basketball students might not be satisfied as they will not have any place to play basketball during recces. Although, the majority of the students will be happy as they will have the opportunity to sit down peacefully and not always have to be cautious of being hit by a ball.</p>

                    <p id="increase_font" class="text-muted text-left"> This is the school swimming pool. This swimming pool is used by everyone (Elementary School, Middle School & High School). The pool is not very big in width although it changes in-depth as you go forward. This pool is used for Physical Education classes, Extra Cirrucalr Subjects, and sometimes just for fun activities. When we practice swimming during PE class we are separated into 2 groups. The starfish and the Dolphins. The starfish students are beginners and they learn how to swim, while the dolphins are good at swimming and they do fun activities which help their swimming get better. The pool is cleaned regularly by the PE department and stays clean all the time for students to use. The school has also bought a lot of pool accessories such as several noodles, tubes, beach ball, floating volleyball net, water guns, torpedo bandits, inflatable basketball hoop, and some squirt toys. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, we haven't been able to use the pool for the past 2 years! </p>

We are let in at 7:45 which gives us 15 mins to get to class. This entry gate is only accessible to middle schoolers. High schoolers and Elementary school students use other entrances. Although, due to Covid-19 we are all using the same entrance as it will be easier for the staff and the security. We will also be able to get more sanitizing stations and that will help prevent Covid-19 in our school. When we enter the school, all the teachers are lined up in stations and they check our temperate first and then sanitize our hands. If our temperate is ok then we are let into the school but if our temperate is too low or too high then they check it again and if it is still the same then we are spent back home and only allowed back into the school after a doctor's approval! </p>

                        This is my TEDx Talk which I spoke about at my school event. My school had a Tedx club which was optional for students to participate in. I participated in this club because I wanted to tell people what I believe and share my talk to the world so I joined this club. At first, I felt like leaving as everything got boring but then my teachers encouraged me and motivated me to continue and so for the next three months I worked very hard in writing, improvising, and speaking my talk. When I recording my practice version my teachers (who gave me suggestions for my talk) said that I had improved so much from my original speech to my practice recording. They were amazed! Hearing all that feedback influenced me to even further improvise my talk and after another week of hard work, my talk had slides, music, and even special effects. I had the best version of my talk ready and I submitted it. I was extremely proud of the work I had done. 2 days after publishing my talk, I got an email from my teachers saying that my talk had been uploaded to the original TedED website! I was so proud of myself that I burst out with happiness. Here is the recording of my final edited talk:

                    This year our school made a lot of improvments to the entrance. They added a securtity office, sanatizing stations, siting areas, and even a new green oval. The main change that happned was that they moved the entrance from the locker area to the swimming pool. Due to that they had to change the sequirty ofice too. And now because of Covid-19 there are sanitizing stations everywhere! They also added sitting areas so that people can wait if the bus got late or there parents forgot to come, or whatever the problem is! Although, the change that most of the students liked was the new green oval. Students come there all the time to socialize, work, or for reccess. </p>

                    This year due to Covid-19, our school has made a new schedule. Our new school schdule is a hybrid learning schedule. We go to school half days and the other half days we work online. The days we go to school we obviously have covid-19 rules (wear a mask, social distancing, etc) and we go the whole day and have 75 min classes. But the days we don't gfo to school we have have 75 min online zoom classes and work from home. This new schedule works out for everyone as when grade 5 and 7 go, then grade 6 and 8 do zoom. When grade 6 and 8 go to school, then grade 5 and 7 take zoom classes.</p>
